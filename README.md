Benchmark sort algorithm
===============================

# Abstract

This paper describes and compares counting sort and bucket sort algorithms implementations written in C language.
The main doubt is what is the impact of pointers operations in \emph{bucket sort} relatively to single operations on arrays
in counting sort.
